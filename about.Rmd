Hello,

Once again, welcome to my website. Please enjoy my following mini-autobiography:


<div class="row" style="padding-top: 30px;">
<div class="col-sm-6">

Here is a self-taken picture of me and the town in which I 
was born. I left this town, St. Gallen, Switzerland, at the age of six when I moved
to the United States. Since then I lived in Ann Arbor, MI, for twelve years, and 
in Berkeley, CA, for the last five. Having experienced these semi-urban environments,
with each consecutive location having a greater pollution problems, I've become interested
in the social-environmental interface. While I originally wanted to express this interest
through architecture, I've transitioned onto the Ph.D. route on which I am studying
[complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory_and_organizations) through data science!

I spent 2012 - 2016 completing a [B.S. 
in the College of Natural Resources](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/conservation-resource-studies/) and a [B.A. in the College of Environmental Design](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/urban-studies/)
at the University of California, Berkeley. These degrees have provided me with
the social and environmental science foundation that I now refer to when studying
these fields in unison.

As mentioned earlier, I am now a graduate student. Specifically, I am working
towards [Ph.D. in Geography, Earth System Science](http://geography.berkeley.edu/graduate-studies/program-description/) (still at Berkeley) while concurrently taking part in a two-year National Science Foundation [Data Science program](http://ds421.berkeley.edu/).
As you may wonder, now that you know I am a geographer: yes, I do produce maps. Though
I should note: these maps are rather complimentary to my research than my main product. I mainly focus on  quantifying relationships within socio-enviornmental systems. Currently I'm looking at critical time scales of water storage in the Sierra Nevada and regime shifts in the Moorean coral reefs. Maps are used as a way to present the spatial data of my work. <br>
Cheers!
