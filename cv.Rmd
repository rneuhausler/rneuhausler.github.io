As part of the Cal Energy Corps internship program, semi-automated step in research process for Edward Ng, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. <br>
Wrote a MATLAB script and functions that semi-automated the process for calculating view factors of various enveloping structural and natural surfaces onto a central point from fisheye images. <br>
In the process of writing the code, I taught myself how to code and how to explain code to the architecture majors that then used it.
