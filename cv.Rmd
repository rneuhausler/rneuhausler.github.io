<center>**Internships**</center>
<br>
**Cal Energy Corps: Urban Climate Study (NT, Hong Kong)** 		      06/2015 - 08/2015 <br>
As part of the Cal Energy Corps internship program, semi-automated step in research process for Edward Ng, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Wrote a MATLAB script and functions that semi-automated the process for calculating view factors of various enveloping structural and natural surfaces onto a central point from fisheye images. 
In the process of writing the code, I taught myself how to code and how to explain code to the architecture majors that then used it. 

**Arndt Geiger Herrmann Architecture Firm (Zurich, Switzerland)** 	      06/2013 - 08/2013 <br>
Designed interior features for an $8 million house on CAD software.
Contributed to numerous projects via presentation preparation and CAD drawings

<center>**Research**</center>
<br>
**Modeling for the Moorea Island Digital Ecosystem Avatar (Oxford, UK)**      05/2016 - Present <br>
Contributing to the Moorea IDEA, a multi-university initiative striving to advance complex systems modeling at the socio-environmental interface. <br>
In collaboration with Dr. Maria Bruna and  Dr. Martin Robinson, spent five weeks over the summer at Oxford University creating a stochastic spatio-temporal model of coral cover as a function of various environmental inputs.

**Salmon Creek Endmember Analysis: Methodological Comparison**	     10/2016 - Present <br>
Comparing stable isotopes and fluorescence in their ability to discriminate between different sources of water within a catchment.
In collaboration with Prof. Laurel Larsen, continuing her initial research on the role of riparian zones in stream water through the combination of flourescence spectroscopy and end member mixing analysis. 

**Fluvial Geomorphology, Everglades Study** 		 	   	      07/2014 - 05/2015 <br>
Research assistant for Laurel Larsen, professor in the Geography Department, UC Berkeley. <br>
Manipulating a provided MATLAB code to perform noise reduction on flow rate data that was then used to determine bed shear stresses for calculating sediment transport. <br>
Compared to observations from Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) data, viewed via Vectrino Profiler playback <br>

**Flood Inundation Simulations of the Bay Area and Sacramento Delta**
03/2014 - 03/2015 <br>
Research assistant for John Radke, professor in Landscape Architecture Department, UC Berkeley <br>
Prepared terrestrial spatial data used in simulating the 100-year storm impact, at various predicted Sea-Level Rise stages, on the California Coast, San Francisco Bay Area, and San Joaquin Delta. <br>
Gathered data through LiDar Analyst tools, & digitizing, and contacting local government agencies. Managed and processed data in multi-server network. <br>
