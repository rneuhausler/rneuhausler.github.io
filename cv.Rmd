<br>

**Cal Energy Corps: Urban Climate Study (NT, Hong Kong)** 		      06/2015 - 08/2015
<br style="line-height: 9px" />
As part of the Cal Energy Corps internship program, semi-automated step in research process
for Edward Ng, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Wrote a MATLAB script and functions that 
semi-automated the process for calculating view factors of various enveloping structural
